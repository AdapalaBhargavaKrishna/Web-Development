# 🌐 Web Development Projects

Welcome to my **Web Development** repository! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of full-stack and frontend projects I’ve built while learning and exploring technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB**, and more.

Each project is a milestone in my journey as a developer — from static sites to interactive web apps powered by APIs, databases, and AI.
