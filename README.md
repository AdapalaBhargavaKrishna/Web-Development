# üåê Web Development Projects

Welcome to my **Web Development** repository! üöÄ  
This repository is a collection of **frontend projects** I‚Äôve built while learning and exploring technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js**, and more.

Each project is a milestone in my journey as a developer ‚Äî from static sites to interactive web apps powered by APIs and responsive UI design.
